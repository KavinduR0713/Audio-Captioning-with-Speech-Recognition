# Audio-Captioning-with-Speech-Recognition
Audio Captioning is a Python-based project that converts audio files into text captions using advanced speech recognition technology. Leveraging the SpeechRecognition library and Google's Web Speech API, it efficiently transcribes spoken words into text. This project is ideal for creating subtitles, transcribing interviews, and more.

## Overview
**Audio Captioning with Speech Recognition** is a Python-based project that leverages speech recognition technology to convert audio files into text captions. The project uses the SpeechRecognition library, which interfaces with the Google Web Speech API to transcribe spoken words into written text. This project is particularly useful for creating subtitles for videos, transcribing interviews, and any other applications where audio-to-text conversion is needed.

## Features

- **Audio File Handling:** The project reads audio data from a file, making it easy to process pre-recorded audio clips.
- **Speech Recognition:** Utilizes Google's Web Speech API to perform high-accuracy speech recognition.
- **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling to manage issues like unrecognizable speech or API request errors.

## Data Science Techniques

### 1. Audio Data Processing
  - **Loading Audio Data:** The SpeechRecognition libraryâ€™s AudioFile class is used to load audio data. This step involves reading the audio file and converting it into a format suitable for recognition.
  - **Recording Audio Data:** The record method of the Recognizer class captures the entire content of the audio file into an AudioData instance, which can then be processed by the recognition algorithm.

### 2. Speech Recognition Algorithm
  - **Google Web Speech API:** The project uses the Google Web Speech API, a state-of-the-art speech-to-text service that applies machine learning models to recognize and transcribe speech. This involves the following steps:
    - **Feature Extraction:** The API processes the audio signal, extracting features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which are critical for understanding the phonetic structure of the spoken words.
    - **Language Model Application:** The recognition service applies language models that have been trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing it to predict and transcribe spoken words accurately.
    - **Alternatives Generation:** The API can generate multiple transcription alternatives with associated confidence scores, providing a robust mechanism to choose the best match.

### 3. Error Handling and Resilience
  - **UnknownValueError:** Handles scenarios where the API cannot understand the audio, ensuring the program can gracefully inform the user about the issue.
  - **RequestError:** Manages network or API-related errors, providing meaningful error messages that help diagnose and resolve issues quickly

## How It Works

### 1. Audio File Input:
- The user provides the path to an audio file, which is loaded using the SpeechRecognition library's AudioFile class.

### 2. Recording Audio Data:
- The Recognizer class's record method reads the entire audio file and stores the data for processing.

### 3. Transcribing Audio:
- The recognize_google method sends the audio data to the Google Web Speech API and retrieves the transcription. By setting show_all=True, multiple transcription alternatives are obtained.

### 4. Selecting the Best Transcription:
- The project selects the best transcription from the alternatives provided by the API. If no alternatives are available, an appropriate message is returned.

### 5. Error Handling:
- If the audio cannot be understood or if there is an issue with the API request, specific error messages are returned to guide the user.
